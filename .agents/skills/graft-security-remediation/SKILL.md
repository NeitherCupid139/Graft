# Graft Security Remediation

Use this skill when a task asks to inspect, classify, remediate, validate, or recheck:

- GitHub `security/code-scanning`
- GitHub `security/dependabot`
- related GitHub Advanced Security findings surfaced through those alert APIs

Treat root `AGENTS.md` as the startup, authority, validation, commit, and closeout source of truth. This skill adds a
security-specific workflow plus reusable inventory assets; it does not create a second release path.

## Workflow

1. Complete the startup preflight from root `AGENTS.md` and classify the task as `server`, `web`, `cross-boundary`, or
   `docs/automation`.
2. Read the required subdomain `AGENTS.md` before edits, then inspect the current worktree with `git status --short`.
3. Build one full open-alert inventory before planning or fixing:

   ```bash
   python3 .agents/skills/graft-security-remediation/scripts/inventory_open_alerts.py \
     --repo GeWuYou/Graft \
     --kind all \
     --output - > /tmp/graft-security-alerts.json
   ```

   Read [references/inventory.md](references/inventory.md) when you need the normalized schema, `gh` examples, or the
   offline import path.
4. Classify every alert as exactly one of:
   - `real-vulnerability`
   - `false-positive`
   - `needs-investigation`
   - `already-remediated-locally`
   - `blocked`
5. Publish a concise remediation plan before edits:
   - in-scope alerts
   - classification evidence
   - intended authority-first repair
   - validation commands
   - branch / commit / recheck path
6. Remediate with the smallest authority-correct fix:
   - verify `source -> sink` for code scanning alerts
   - verify direct vs indirect usage and patched version reality for dependency alerts
   - do not add suppressions, aliases, or compatibility layers unless root `AGENTS.md` exception rules are satisfied
7. Run the smallest correct validation for the touched scope:
   - `server`: focused `go test`, then `go run ./cmd/graft validate backend --stage lint`
   - `web`: `bun run check`
   - `cross-boundary`: validate both sides
8. Recheck after local validation. Read [references/recheck.md](references/recheck.md) when you need the standard
   evidence checklist or post-push expectations.

## Guardrails

- Do not start with a partial subset of alerts when a full inventory is still missing.
- Do not claim `false-positive` or `already-remediated-locally` without code-level evidence from the current branch.
- Do not invent remote write steps as the default path. Push, PR creation, alert dismissal, and any GitHub write action
  require explicit user request or an owning repository skill that authorizes that write path.
- Keep the owned scope limited to the confirmed remediation slice; do not bundle unrelated worktree changes.

## Closeout Evidence

```text
Security remediation evidence:
- inventory_source: gh-api | local-json | mixed
- alerts_reviewed: <count by kind>
- disposition_summary: real / false-positive / stale / blocked
- authority_repair: <canonical layer changed or no-change>
- validation: <commands and results>
- recheck_status: local-only | pushed-awaiting-github | github-confirmed
```
