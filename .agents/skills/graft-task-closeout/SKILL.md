description: Repository-specific end-of-task closeout workflow for Graft. Use when a task slice is ending and the agent needs to decide whether to emit only a next-step startup prompt or to commit the current validated slice first and then hand off safely. This is the default slice-end path for work started through `graft-boot`.

# Graft Task Closeout

Use this skill when the current `Graft` slice is ending and the agent needs a concise, repeatable closeout workflow.
When a slice started through `graft-boot`, treat this skill as the normal required wrap-up path rather than an
optional extra.

Treat root `AGENTS.md` as the closeout-governance source of truth. This skill coordinates existing repository skills; it
does not replace startup, validation, or commit rules.

## When To Use

Typical triggers:

* `close this slice`
* `wrap up and hand off`
* `generate the next-step startup prompt`
* `commit current validated slice if needed and hand off`

Prefer this skill over `graft-commit` when the main question is task closeout rather than commit creation alone.

## Preconditions

1. Ensure the current turn already has the startup receipt required by `AGENTS.md` `4.1 Startup Governance`.
2. Confirm the task is actually at a closeout point:
   - the current slice is complete enough to hand off, or
   - the current slice is blocked and needs an honest next-step prompt
3. If validation status is unclear, use `graft-validation-runner` before deciding whether a commit is allowed.

## Workflow

1. Read the closeout rules in `AGENTS.md`:
   - `4.1 Startup Governance` for required handoff prompt fields
   - `13. Git Workflow Rules` for pre-handoff commit requirements
2. Classify the closeout state:
   - `validated and owned`: the current slice reached the required validation level and ownership is clear
   - `handoff only`: the slice needs a next-step prompt but is not ready for a safe commit
   - `blocked`: ownership, validation, or scope is too ambiguous to claim closure
3. Decide whether a commit is required:
   - if the task ends with a real next-task handoff and the current slice reached the required validation level, prefer
     committing the confirmed owned scope before handoff
   - if validation is still insufficient, do not force a commit; record the exact gap
   - if ownership is mixed or ambiguous, do not force a commit; keep the scope uncommitted
4. Always evaluate commit eligibility using `graft-commit` rules, even when the answer may be “do not commit yet”.
5. If a commit is justified or explicitly requested, delegate commit execution to `graft-commit`:
   - keep the scope limited to the confirmed owned slice
   - reuse the same ownership and validation rules instead of inventing a second commit path
6. Emit one explicit next-task startup prompt whenever the output hands work to a future turn. The prompt must include:
   - `governance source`
   - `task class`
   - `recovery source`
   - `owned scope`
   - if recovery context matters, the parent topic and subtopic to read after startup preflight
7. Report the closeout result concisely:
   - whether a commit was created, and if so the scoped title and short SHA
   - whether the output is a handoff prompt only
   - what validation was used or what exact validation gap remains

## Output Contract

The closeout result should stay concise and should contain:

1. `closeout status`: `committed and handed off`, `handoff only`, or `blocked`
2. `validation`: exact command run or the exact limitation
3. `next-step startup prompt`: only when a future turn is expected

Use plain language, but keep the startup prompt explicit enough that the next turn can rerun startup preflight without
guessing the inherited context.

## Boundaries

* do not treat this skill as permission to commit unrelated changes
* do not duplicate `graft-boot`; this skill assumes startup already happened in the current turn
* do not duplicate `graft-validation-runner`; use it when validation scope is uncertain
* do not duplicate `graft-commit`; use its rules for every commit-eligibility decision and use it directly when the
  decision is to create a commit
* do not claim the next turn can skip startup preflight

## Example Startup Prompt Template

`You are handling a <task class> task. Governance source: root AGENTS.md. Task class: <task class>. Recovery source: <none|parent topic|parent topic + subtopic>. Owned scope: <owned scope>. First rerun startup preflight from AGENTS.md 4.1, then continue with <next step>.`
