# Frontend Style Guidelines

This document records `web` frontend style rules that apply across business modules and shell pages.

## Typography Token Usage

Business-visible text in `web` must be token-driven. Page, module, and shell UI text must not directly use fixed
`font-size` values such as `12px`, `13px`, `14px`, `16px`, or similar hardcoded pixel scales.

Page text should prefer TDesign font tokens so light mode, dark mode, brand theme, and personalization font-size settings
can change text size consistently. When a page needs a different hierarchy, choose the nearest TDesign token first
instead of adding a local pixel value.

Recommended mapping:

| Usage                                            | Recommended token |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Helper text, hints, secondary metadata           | `body-small`      |
| Default body copy, table values, field values    | `body-medium`     |
| Card titles, compact section titles              | `title-small`     |
| Page sections, drawer titles, major panel titles | `title-medium`    |
| Page main titles                                 | `title-large`     |

Allowed hardcoded exception categories:

- Icon sizes.
- Chart axis, tooltip, and legend text.
- Logo typography or logo-mark text.
- Badge, avatar, and numeric badge internals.
- Fixed-format controls where layout dimensions are part of the control contract.
- Code editor or monospace preview surfaces.
- Necessary third-party component overrides.
- Height-coupled visual elements where text size must match a fixed visual asset or component height.

Every exception must record a reason near the declaration or in the owning style guideline. The reason should explain why
a TDesign token cannot represent the requirement for this specific surface.

### Review Checklist

- Business-visible text uses TDesign font tokens rather than hardcoded `font-size` pixel values.
- Any hardcoded font-size exception fits one allowed category and records a reason.
- The selected token matches the information hierarchy instead of being chosen only to match an old pixel size.
- Table cells, field values, helper text, drawer titles, card titles, and page titles follow the recommended token
  mapping unless a documented exception applies.
- Font size responds to personalization font-size settings.
- Personalization font-size control is used as the regression validation sample for typography changes.

## Scroll Containers

Business pages in `web` must not let internal scroll surfaces drift into page-local one-off behavior.

- Independent scroll viewports such as JSON viewers, log panes, drawer bodies, markdown tables, and embedded terminal
  surfaces must reuse the shared project scrollbar styling rather than shipping browser-default scrollbars.
- When one page owns multiple internal scroll panels, the height authority must stay at the page or layout container
  boundary. Child components should fill the provided space and manage only their own internal overflow.
- Interactive embedded surfaces with their own scroll context, especially terminals and code/log viewers, must isolate
  scroll chaining so wheel input inside the surface does not continue scrolling the outer page container.
- New local `scrollbar-color`, `scrollbar-width`, or `::-webkit-scrollbar*` rules are allowed only when the shared
  scrollbar utility cannot represent a verified requirement for that surface.

### Review Checklist

- Internal scroll viewports use the shared scrollbar utility instead of ad hoc scrollbar rules.
- Page-level containers, not child components, own viewport-height math for long-form tab or panel layouts.
- Embedded terminals, log viewers, and code/JSON panes prevent wheel chaining from unintentionally moving the page.
