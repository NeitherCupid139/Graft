# System Config Model Unification Trace

## 2026-06-10 design topic creation

- Re-ran startup preflight for a docs/automation task with cross-boundary impact:
  - read root `AGENTS.md`
  - read `.ai/environment/tools.ai.yaml`
  - read `server/AGENTS.md`
  - read `web/AGENTS.md`
  - read `ai-plan/design/AI任务追踪与恢复设计.md`
  - read `ai-plan/public/README.md`
- Used `$graft-system-config-field-renderer` as the System Config field-renderer governance source.
- Reused prior exploration findings:
  - current registry already has domain/group metadata and object value support
  - current object config is represented by `type=object` plus `config_schema.properties`
  - current OpenAPI exposes `config_schema` but not an explicit `fields` derived view
  - current web module consumes generated OpenAPI types and has shared schema-form primitives
  - TDesign Vue Next covers the baseline field editor matrix with Select, Switch, InputNumber, Textarea, and Input
- Created `ai-plan/design/系统配置模型与渲染设计.md` as repository-level design truth.
- Created active topic recovery files under `ai-plan/public/system-config-model-unification/`.
- Updated `ai-plan/public/README.md` so future startup recovery can find this active topic.

## 2026-06-10 Phase 1 UI consistency implementation

- Implemented a `web` System Config Phase 1 consistency slice without backend model or OpenAPI changes.
- Updated the list page to build explicit Config Object card view models from existing item + `config_schema` authority.
- Moved technical ID, raw JSON, and schema summary into advanced collapse sections.
- Added drawer editing for arrays, nested object fields, large strings, and larger object schemas while keeping small
  scalar/object edits in the existing dialog.
- Extended shared schema-form rendering so object/array properties can be edited as JSON textarea fields with per-field
  validation feedback.
- Updated `zh-CN` and `en-US` module locale entries plus page tests for the new display and editor behavior.
- Validation: `cd web && bun run check`.

## 2026-06-10 Phase 2 renderer extraction implementation

- Ran a loop-orchestrated worker round for Phase 2 with a web-focused owned scope.
- Used `$graft-system-config-field-renderer` as the renderer baseline:
  - schema enum -> Select
  - boolean -> Switch
  - integer/number -> InputNumber
  - object/array -> JSON textarea
  - string -> Input
  - `item.type` fallback only when schema cannot decide.
- Queried TDesign MCP for `Select`, `Switch`, `InputNumber`, `Textarea`, `Input`, `Form`, `Dialog`, `Drawer`, and
  `Collapse`; retained the existing component choices.
- Extracted shared renderer boundaries:
  - `ConfigEditorRenderer`
  - `ConfigValueRenderer`
  - renderer decision and editor-container helpers
  - schema-driven editor validation helpers
- Updated the System Config page to consume the shared renderer boundaries while preserving Phase 1 card layout,
  advanced information, and dialog-vs-drawer behavior.
- Added focused tests for schema-first renderer decisions, scalar enum/range validation, and page integration without
  key-specific mappings.
- Focused validation:
  - `cd web && bun run test:run src/shared/schema-form/config-schema.test.ts src/modules/system-config/pages/list/index.test.ts`
  - `cd web && bun run typecheck`
- Completion validation:
  - `cd web && bun run check`

## 2026-06-10 Phase 3 backend registry/OpenAPI enhancement implementation

- Ran a loop-orchestrated worker round for Phase 3 with a backend-focused owned scope.
- Reused the scheduler-owned JSON Schema subset as the validation authority instead of adding a second parser:
  - added scalar root validation for `enum`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `minLength`, and `maxLength`
  - preserved the existing flat object validation subset for object config values
  - used the registered `ConfigDefinition.Type` when scalar `config_schema.type` is omitted
- Updated config registry validation so module-owned scalar defaults must also satisfy their declared schema.
- Updated System Config override validation so scalar updates reject values outside schema constraints.
- Deferred the optional derived `fields` response view; `config_schema` remains the only field-rendering authority and
  OpenAPI/generated artifacts were not changed in this slice.
- Added focused backend tests for scalar schema validation in:
  - `server/internal/scheduler`
  - `server/internal/configregistry`
  - `server/modules/system-config`
- TDesign MCP was not applicable because no TDesign component usage or frontend rendering code changed.
- Focused validation:
  - `cd server && go test ./internal/scheduler ./internal/configregistry ./modules/system-config`
  - `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend --stage lint`

## 2026-06-10 Phase 4 typical config migration implementation

- Ran a loop-orchestrated worker round for Phase 4 with a cross-boundary owned scope.
- Used `$graft-system-config-field-renderer` for schema/i18n authority:
  - `ConfigDefinition.Schema` remains the field-rendering and runtime-validation authority.
  - TDesign MCP was not applicable because no TDesign component usage changed.
- Kept log retention object baseline unchanged.
- Migrated dashboard quick actions from three flat scalar keys to canonical object key `dashboard.quick_actions`:
  - fields: `enabled`, `maxItems`, `strategy`
  - strict object schema with required fields, `additionalProperties=false`, defaults, range constraints, and enum labels.
  - web dashboard runtime resolver now reads only the canonical object key.
- Migrated notification display from two flat scalar keys to canonical object key `notification.display`:
  - fields: `showReadDays`, `popupLimit`
  - strict object schema with required fields, `additionalProperties=false`, defaults, range constraints, and field i18n keys.
- Did not migrate `notification.general.defaults`; Phase 4 evaluated it as out of scope/low urgency per design guidance.
- Removed stale system-config locale/test fixture references to the old flat dashboard and notification display keys, except
  tests that explicitly assert removed keys are ignored or not registered.
- OpenAPI source and generated artifacts were not changed because the list/detail item wire shape did not change.
- Focused validation:
  - `cd server && go test ./internal/dashboard ./modules/notification ./internal/configregistry ./modules/system-config`
  - `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend --stage lint`
  - `cd web && bun run test:run src/modules/dashboard/contract/quick-actions.test.ts src/modules/dashboard/pages/index.test.ts src/modules/system-config/pages/list/index.test.ts src/shared/schema-form/config-schema.test.ts scripts/check-i18n-governance.test.ts`
  - `cd web && bun run check`

## 2026-06-11 Phase 5 validation/archive readiness

- Ran a final loop-orchestrated worker round for Phase 5 with docs/archive scope only.
- Confirmed working tree started clean before Phase 5 docs/archive changes.
- Confirmed Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 implementation commits were present:
  - `cdd5bb4c`
  - `de1979a5`
  - `494e561d`
- Verified no old flat-key runtime or web consumers remain:
  - old dashboard keys such as `dashboard.quick_actions.enabled`, `dashboard.quick_actions.max_items`, and
    `dashboard.quick_actions.strategy` remain only in design migration-before notes and tests that assert removed keys
    are ignored or not registered.
  - old notification keys such as `notification.display.show_read_days` and `notification.display.popup_limit` remain
    only in design migration-before notes and tests that assert removed keys are not registered.
- Final non-browser validation:
  - `cd server && go test ./internal/scheduler ./internal/configregistry ./internal/dashboard ./modules/system-config ./modules/notification`
  - `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend --stage lint`
  - `cd web && bun run check`
- Browser validation was skipped because the Phase 5 worker was explicitly prohibited from browser validation by user
  constraint.
- Archived the topic under `ai-plan/public/archive/system-config-model-unification/` and removed it from active topics
  in `ai-plan/public/README.md`.
- Terminal status: `archive-ready`.
