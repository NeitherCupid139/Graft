# System Config Model Unification

## Current Status

- Status: `archive-ready`.
- Task class: `docs/automation with cross-boundary impact`.
- Goal: promote the System Config information architecture, object/scalar boundary, field renderer baseline, and phased
  optimization route into repository design truth.
- Primary design authority:
  - `ai-plan/design/系统配置模型与渲染设计.md`
- Loop mode: `topic-completion-loop`.
- Completed commits:
  - `1cec4212` - Phase 1 UI consistency
  - `f2738c67` - Phase 1 numeric stepper unit follow-up
  - `cdd5bb4c` - Phase 2 renderer extraction
  - `de1979a5` - Phase 3 backend registry/OpenAPI enhancement
  - `494e561d` - Phase 4 typical config migration

## Recovery Receipt

- governance source: root `AGENTS.md`
- task class: `docs/automation with cross-boundary impact`
- recovery source: `parent topic`
- authority summary: repository-level System Config design is the canonical long-term guidance; module-owned
  `ConfigDefinition` and `config_schema` remain runtime/schema authority; OpenAPI source remains wire-contract
  authority; `web/src/modules/system-config` and `web/src/shared/schema-form` are downstream UI consumers.

## Active Scope

- Keep archived evidence focused on System Config model and renderer governance.
- Runtime implementation phases are complete for this topic.
- No further same-session implementation batch is pending.

## Entry Points

- Tracking: `ai-plan/public/archive/system-config-model-unification/todos/system-config-model-unification-tracking.md`
- Trace: `ai-plan/public/archive/system-config-model-unification/traces/system-config-model-unification-trace.md`

## Archive-Ready Decision

- Decision: `archive-ready`.
- Reason: all planned implementation phases are committed, final non-browser cross-boundary validation passed, and no
  old flat-key runtime or web consumers remain.
- Browser validation: skipped because the Phase 5 worker was explicitly prohibited from browser validation by user
  constraint.
- Authority remains:
  - module-owned `ConfigDefinition.Schema` / `config_schema` for field rendering and runtime validation
  - OpenAPI source for shared wire contracts
  - no old-key compatibility or fallback behavior
