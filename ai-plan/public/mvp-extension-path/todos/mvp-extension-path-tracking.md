# MVP Extension Path Tracking

## Topic

- Topic: `mvp-extension-path`
- Branch: `feat/mvp-extension-path`
- Scope: `server/core`, platform registries, initial plugins, and the `web` shell required by the MVP path

## Goal

- Keep one long-lived recovery entrypoint for the MVP extension path while the repository is still stabilizing its core
  architecture and implementation sequence.

## Repository Truth

- `ai-plan/design/项目设计.md`
- `ai-plan/design/插件与依赖注入设计.md`
- `ai-plan/design/前端架构设计.md`
- `ai-plan/roadmap/MVP实施计划.md`
- `ai-plan/design/AI任务追踪与恢复设计.md`

## Stages

- Stage A: core runtime
- Stage B: platform registries
- Stage C: initial plugins
- Stage D: web shell and dynamic menu path

## Current Recovery Point

- The repository AI workflow has been upgraded from `plan/` to `ai-plan/`.
- Repository-wide design truth now lives in `ai-plan/design/`.
- Repository-wide implementation sequencing now lives in `ai-plan/roadmap/`.
- The long-lived branch `feat/mvp-extension-path` has been created and is now the default execution branch for this
  topic.
- Repository-wide environment truth now lives under `.ai/environment/`, with scripts that regenerate raw and AI-facing
  inventories.
- This topic is the default recovery entrypoint for future MVP-path work.
- The repository now contains the first substantive MVP shell implementation across both `server` and `web`.
- `server` has a minimal runtime shell with explicit plugin registration, lifecycle ordering, registries, and a sample
  `user` plugin.
- `server` now uses an env-first configuration path with PostgreSQL and Redis as required core infrastructure.
- `server/go.mod` keeps direct dependencies documented and leaves indirect dependencies in standard Go tool format.
- `web` has a minimal Vue 3 + TDesign admin shell with `AuthLayout`, `BasicLayout`, static routing, mock auth, and a
  navigation store reserved for backend-driven menu metadata.
- Repository truth for the planned server-wide ORM migration now uses Ent as the backend ORM baseline.
- Repository truth for schema changes now uses Atlas versioned migrations executed through an explicit CLI step before
  application startup, not during runtime boot.
- Plugin-facing design truth now reserves a neutral repository / store factory boundary instead of exposing a concrete
  ORM handle through `plugin.Context` or cross-plugin public services.
- `server` now uses an Ent-backed database bootstrap, a Cobra CLI with `graft migrate up`, and a repository / store
  factory boundary in `plugin.Context`.
- `server` no longer exposes `*gorm.DB` or a runtime migration registry through the plugin lifecycle surface.
- The initial Ent schema, generated client, and Atlas-versioned SQL baseline now live under `server/internal/ent/`.
- Repository automation now includes a `graft-pr-review` skill that can resolve the current branch PR through the
  GitHub API and extract AI review findings, failed checks, MegaLinter warnings, and failed test signals into a local
  verification input.
- `server` now enforces an explicit MVP-only backend permission guard for protected plugin routes instead of relying on
  frontend route metadata alone.
- `server` runtime shutdown now honors reverse plugin `Shutdown` ordering and closes Redis / database resources on both
  startup failures and normal process exit.
- `graft migrate up` now resolves the default Atlas migration directory from either the repository root or the server
  module root so the CLI does not depend on one fragile working directory.
- `server/internal/httpx` now serializes `Run` / `Shutdown` lifecycle ownership through one guarded server pointer so
  concurrent start-stop transitions cannot race on partially applied runtime state.
- `graft-pr-review` now prefers native `git` before the Windows fallback in WSL-like shells, keeps JSON stdout stable
  when `--json-output` is requested, and treats visible `Addressed in commit` markers as resolved review threads.

## Active Risks

- Future work must keep repository-wide design truth and topic-level recovery documents aligned instead of creating a
  second source of truth.
- The main implementation risk is replacing existing runtime assumptions around startup-time migrations and direct DB
  handle access without leaking Ent-specific details across plugin boundaries.
- Atlas CLI execution has not yet been validated against a real local PostgreSQL instance in this environment because
  the `atlas` binary is not installed and no target database was exercised during this change.
- The current backend permission gate is an explicit MVP placeholder based on request headers; it still needs the real
  auth + RBAC plugin chain before the authorization contract can be considered production-ready.

  Atlas versioned migrations, explicit migration CLI flow, and repository / store factory boundaries.

## Immediate Next Step

- Run the first real Atlas migration against a disposable PostgreSQL instance, then replace the temporary header-based
  backend permission gate with the real auth + RBAC plugin chain.
