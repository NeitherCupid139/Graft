# OAPI Generated Server/Client Governance Spike Trace

## 2026-05-25 implementation spike

- Renamed the worktree topic branch from `feat/wt-oapi-codegen-types-only-spike` to `feat/oapi-generated-server-client-governance-spike`.
- Added a monitor-only generated OpenAPI server contract package under `server/internal/contract/openapi/monitor/**`.
- Kept the backend router ownership explicit:
  - the monitor plugin still registers `GET /api/monitor/server-status` itself
  - the generated layer only owns parameter binding and compile-time handler interface conformance
- Rejected `strict-server` for this pilot implementation because it would force the response envelope away from `httpx`.
- Updated the monitor frontend module API so the server-status call is now operation-bound to generated OpenAPI typings while still running through `request.ts`.
- Kept page/module boundaries unchanged:
  - pages still call module API helpers
  - no page directly consumes generated client/runtime code

## Validation Notes

- The generated Go server binding emits the expected OpenAPI `3.1.x` warning from `oapi-codegen`.
- That warning does not block the pilot, but it remains a real governance risk for future broader rollout.

## 2026-05-25 Phase 4 governance review

- Completed the Phase 4 docs-only governance review for commit `eda1849`.
- Classified the spike verdict as `partial success`, not `success` and not `failed`.
- Confirmed the backend generated server adapter stayed narrow:
  - it constrains handler shape and generated parameter/header/query semantics
  - it does not take over plugin route registration, Gin middleware, `httpx` envelope ownership, or localized error handling
- Confirmed the frontend adapter delivered the clearer governance win:
  - monitor module API now binds to generated operation types
  - module response types now alias generated schemas
  - `request.ts` remains the only transport/runtime truth
  - pages continue to consume only module API and module-owned types
- Confirmed the minimal governance patches stayed proportionate:
  - generated-file lint exclusions are scoped to the monitor generated file
  - backend validation cache namespacing is limited to temp-cache isolation by module-root hash
- Recorded the main remaining gap:
  - there is still no explicit backend generated artifact freshness gate equivalent to frontend `bun run openapi:types:check`
- Settled the recommendation order:
  - first add a generated freshness/check gate
  - do not expand the pilot to another interface before that gate exists
  - do not promote generated runtime server/client ownership from this topic
- If expansion is revisited after freshness gating lands, the next low-risk candidate should be `GET /api/permissions`, not an auth/session route and not a write-heavy interface.

forbidden scope:

objective:
  - 为 monitor generated server/client pilot 设计并收口最小 generated freshness/check gate
  - 明确 backend generated Go artifact 与 frontend generated TS schema 的 blocking/non-blocking gate 位置
  - 判断该 gate 应该落在 docs/automation 还是单独的新治理 topic
validation:
  - git diff --check
  - git status --short
```


## 2026-05-25 Phase 5 freshness gate

- Added `scripts/openapi_generated_freshness_check.py` as the repository-owned backend generated freshness gate.
- Kept the gate in `check` mode by default:
  - regenerate monitor-only generated Go output to a temp file
  - diff against `server/internal/contract/openapi/monitor/zz_generated.types.go`
  - fail if the tracked generated artifact is stale or manually edited
- Added explicit `--mode fix` support, but did not mix regeneration into normal validation behavior.
- Wired backend freshness into `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend` through the existing `openapi` stage.
- Confirmed frontend freshness remains owned by `cd web && bun run openapi:types:check`; this slice does not replace it.
- Kept the scope monitor-only and did not broaden generated runtime coverage or endpoint migration.
