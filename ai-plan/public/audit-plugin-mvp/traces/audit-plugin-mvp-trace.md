# Audit Plugin MVP Trace

## 2026-05-27 Batch 0 started

- Received a bounded `graft-multi-agent-loop` startup prompt for topic `audit-plugin-mvp`.
- Confirmed the task must not start runtime implementation before exploration of plugin, migration, OpenAPI, frontend
  bootstrap, and RBAC guard patterns.

## 2026-05-27 first audit worktree attempt corrected

- Verified the source RBAC worktree was clean before any topic split work.
- The first audit worktree attempt was incorrectly created from `main`, which produced an older code baseline missing
  the expected OpenAPI/generated contract chain.
- Stopped using that incorrect worktree, removed it, and recreated `feat/wt-audit-plugin-mvp` from the clean RBAC
  worktree baseline commit `4cd907e`.
- Re-ran startup preflight inside the corrected audit worktree before continuing.

## 2026-05-27 startup receipt re-established

- Governance source: `root AGENTS.md`
- Task class: `cross-boundary`
- Recovery source:
  - `ai-plan/public/README.md`
  - archived `ai-plan/public/archive/backend-rbac-contract-audit`
  - current plugin registry implementation
  - current user plugin implementation
  - current rbac plugin implementation
  - current OpenAPI/generated contract workflow
  - current web module/bootstrap/route implementation
- Loop mode: `topic-completion-loop`

## 2026-05-27 exploration findings

- The repository already contains a minimal `server/plugins/audit` plugin.
- The current audit plugin registers request-level middleware and subscribes to `pluginapi.AuditRecordEventName`.
- The current audit DTO and repository are write-only; no query contract or web module exists yet.
- Plugin descriptors declare plugin-owned migration paths, and `pluginregistry` states default migration selection
  expands plugin-owned directories rather than the historical shared migration directory.
- `graft migrate up` synthesizes the default Atlas chain from ordered plugin-owned migration directories.
- `server/internal/httpx` is the canonical envelope and authz boundary:
  - request ids come from `EnsureRequestID`
  - localized error `messageKey` is stored in request context
  - `RequirePermission` injects `pluginapi.RequestAuthContext`
- Canonical OpenAPI and generated contract workflow exists in this corrected baseline:
  - source spec in `openapi/openapi.yaml` plus `openapi/paths/**`
  - backend generated types under `server/internal/contract/openapi/**`
  - web generated schema at `web/src/contracts/openapi/generated/schema.ts`
- Frontend module routing remains bootstrap-driven:
  - `web/src/modules/index.ts` auto-discovers module registrations
  - `permission` store converts bootstrap menus to dynamic routes
  - global route guards restore bootstrap and mount routes at runtime
  - UI visibility uses `v-permission` plus page-local computed guards
- The best future richer-audit insertion points are business success paths in:
  - `server/plugins/user/plugin.go`
  - `server/plugins/rbac/write_service.go`

## Recovery Notes

- Batch 0 remains docs-and-exploration only until the docs slice is validated and committed.
- Shared hotspots remain serialized exceptions; no standing ownership is assumed outside the declared topic scope.

## 2026-05-27 Batch 1 verified and closed

- Audited the existing uncommitted Batch 1 candidate against the topic goal instead of trusting the README/tracking claim.
- Confirmed the backend audit domain stayed on the existing plugin baseline and added the required richer schema and service surface:
  - `Record(ctx, input)`
  - `List(ctx, query)`
  - actor identity, resource naming, request id, message, JSON metadata, and created-at persistence
- Confirmed sensitive-field filtering exists in both free-text and JSON metadata paths.
- Confirmed non-blocking semantics hold for request middleware and event-bus active audit writes.
- Confirmed the migration stayed plugin-owned under `server/plugins/audit/migrations/**` and refreshed `atlas.sum`.
- Added/verified bounded tests for service sanitization, repository create/list filters, and non-blocking plugin behavior.
- Validation result:
  - `cd server && go test ./...` passed
  - `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend` initially failed on owned-scope lint issues, then passed after local fixes in `sanitize.go`, `pluginapi/audit.go`, `plugin.go`, and `storeent/repository.go`
  - `git diff --check` passed
- Batch status is now truly aligned with docs: Batch 1 complete, Batch 2 remains the next batch and was not started in this round.

## 2026-05-27 Batch 2 retry worker recovered partial state and closed Batch 2

- Re-established startup governance from root `AGENTS.md`, `server/AGENTS.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, and the audit topic
  recovery docs before touching the carried-over partial diff.
- Audited the inherited partial state instead of discarding it:
  - kept the existing `plugin.go` lifecycle direction
  - kept the draft audit contract and route files where they matched repository patterns
  - rewrote only the parts that drifted from actual generated/OpenAPI/authz contracts
- Closed the Batch 2 backend read contract by adding plugin-owned:
  - permission code `audit.read`
  - menu title key `menu.audit.logs.title`
  - menu/API path alignment on `/audit/logs`
  - guarded route registration at `/api/audit/logs`
  - read-service registration and authz guard resolution through existing `pluginapi.AuthService` and `pluginapi.Authorizer`
- Added audit OpenAPI contract closure:
  - root spec path `/api/audit/logs`
  - audit list schemas and enveloped response schema
  - narrow generated package `server/internal/contract/openapi/audit`
  - refreshed checked-in bundle `openapi/dist/openapi.bundle.json`
  - refreshed backend generated types `server/internal/contract/openapi/generated/types.gen.go`
- Corrected two real partial-state contract bugs during takeover:
  - the first draft had route registration on `/api/audit` while menu/OpenAPI targeted `/audit/logs`
  - the first draft bound generated `created_from` / `created_to` params as `string` instead of generated `time.Time`
- Added/updated bounded audit plugin tests so Batch 2 registration now verifies:
  - authz dependencies are available in the plugin context
  - request middleware and active-event behavior still work
  - permission/menu/read-route surface is mounted and responds on the guarded route
- Validation result:
  - `cd server && go test ./...` passed
  - `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend` passed after refactoring the audit query binder to satisfy owned-scope `gocognit`
  - `git diff --check` passed
  - `cd web && bun ../scripts/openapi-bundle.mjs` ran to refresh the bundled spec used by backend generated types
  - `cd server && go generate ./internal/contract/openapi` ran to refresh backend generated contract artifacts
- Batch status is now truly aligned with docs: Batch 2 complete, next batch is Batch 3 backend write-path integration.

## 2026-05-27 Batch 3 implemented richer backend recording integration

- Kept the settled Batch 2 read contract unchanged and limited Batch 3 to bounded backend write-path integration.
- Wired `server/plugins/user` active-audit publish points into these successful management writes:
  - create user
  - update user
  - set user status
  - delete user
  - reset user password
- Wired `server/plugins/rbac` active-audit publish points into these successful management writes:
  - create/update/status/delete role
  - replace/add/remove role permissions
  - replace/add/remove user roles
- Preserved non-blocking semantics for audit failures on the business success path:
  - user and rbac write services now log and swallow event-bus publish failures instead of failing the write result
  - request-level automatic audit middleware remains as fallback coverage
- Added request-id propagation from current user/rbac write routes into the active audit event payload without widening
  the `/api/audit/logs` API contract or request-context architecture outside owned scope.
- Added bounded tests to confirm:
  - successful user active-audit publish
  - successful rbac active-audit publish
  - audit publish failures remain non-blocking
- Validation result:
  - `cd server && go test ./...` passed
  - `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend` passed
  - `git diff --check` passed
- Batch status is now truly aligned with docs: Batch 3 complete, next batch is Batch 4 frontend audit module and page.

## 2026-05-27 Batch 4 implemented frontend audit module and page

- Re-established startup governance from root `AGENTS.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, `server/AGENTS.md`, and the audit topic
  recovery docs before frontend implementation.
- Ran TDesign MCP preflight under `vue-next` before coding:
  - `get_component_list`
  - `get_component_docs` for `table`, `input`, `select`, `date-picker`, `button`, `card`, `space`, `tag`, `loading`,
    `empty`, `alert`, `pagination`
  - `get_component_dom` for `table`, `card`, `alert`, `empty`
- Declared the page as extension type `log-audit` and kept the structure on the existing management-page shell:
  - page header
  - filter toolbar
  - readonly note / feedback surface
  - table surface
  - footer pagination
- Added a module-owned audit web slice under `web/src/modules/audit/**` with:
  - module registration
  - bootstrap route declaration for `/audit/logs`
  - route/API/permission contract values
  - generated-schema-backed API adapter for `/api/audit/logs`
  - read-only audit log page and locale bundles
- Refreshed `web/src/contracts/openapi/generated/schema.ts` because the frontend now consumes the audit read contract.
- Kept backend semantics unchanged:
  - no backend API rewrite
  - no permission or menu redesign
  - no second frontend route or API client baseline
- Added bounded frontend tests covering the new bootstrap route and page smoke path, and extended existing module /
  route / locale governance tests for audit ownership.

## 2026-05-27 Batch 4 retry worker closed the partial frontend state

- Took over the carried-over Batch 4 partial diff instead of rewriting the slice from scratch.
- Confirmed the inherited frontend module layout, bootstrap route wiring, generated schema refresh, locale additions, and
  route governance tests were directionally correct and kept them in place.
- Closed the remaining frontend-only validation gaps inside owned scope:
  - wired `AUDIT_PERMISSION_CODE.READ` into visible audit page actions so the module-owned permission contract is part
    of the real runtime surface instead of an unused side file
  - reduced audit-page local duplication to satisfy repository `jscpd` / hygiene checks without widening into shared
    refactors
  - converted the audit page smoke test to explicit TDesign/directive stubs so it validates the settled page/data
    contract instead of depending on global runtime component registration
- Validation result:
  - `cd web && bun run check` passed
  - `git diff --check` passed
- Batch status is now truly aligned with docs: Batch 4 complete and validated, next batch is Batch 5 cross-boundary
  integration and regression.

## 2026-05-28 Batch 5 closed cross-boundary integration and regression

- Re-established startup governance from root `AGENTS.md`, `server/AGENTS.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, and the audit topic
  recovery docs before running regression.
- Confirmed the worktree baseline matched the expected Batch 4 closeout state:
  - `HEAD` stayed at `35a1e07`
  - `git status --short` was clean before Batch 5 work
- Audited the settled backend and frontend closure path instead of reopening implementation:
  - backend audit plugin still registers canonical `audit.read`, `/audit/logs`, and the guarded `/api/audit/logs`
    surface
  - frontend bootstrap route recovery still resolves `/audit/logs` through module registration and permission-store
    route mounting
  - frontend audit API adapter still consumes generated OpenAPI DTOs through the canonical request-envelope path
- Reconfirmed the regression-proof tests already cover the required closure points:
  - backend read-surface coverage in `server/plugins/audit/plugin_test.go`
  - bootstrap menu -> route recovery coverage in `web/src/utils/route/bootstrap.test.ts`
  - module bootstrap identity coverage in `web/src/modules/audit/bootstrap-routes.test.ts`
  - audit page generated-contract render smoke coverage in `web/src/modules/audit/pages/index.test.ts`
- Validation result:
  - `cd server && go test ./...` passed
  - `cd server && go run ./cmd/graft validate backend` passed
  - `cd web && bun run check` passed
  - `git diff --check` passed
- No bounded integration defect was discovered, so no owned-scope runtime code fix was required in Batch 5.
- Batch status is now truly aligned with docs: Batch 5 complete and validated, next batch is Batch 6 archive-ready
  closeout.

## 2026-05-28 server governance docs slice recorded

- Ran a docs-only governance slice to institutionalize the current server agent development flow instead of changing
  backend business code.
- Updated `server/AGENTS.md` to add:
  - `Server Task Lifecycle`
  - boundary decision matrix
  - plugin implementation checklist
  - explicit prohibitions
  - closeout record template
- Updated `ai-plan/design/插件与依赖注入设计.md` to explain why the server execution truth must stay in
  `server/AGENTS.md` and why compile-time registry, explicit migration/startup separation, and plugin-owned boundaries
  require these workflow rules.
- This slice touched governance docs only:
  - no `server/internal/**` runtime implementation changed
  - no `server/plugins/**` business implementation changed
  - no schema or migration implementation changed
