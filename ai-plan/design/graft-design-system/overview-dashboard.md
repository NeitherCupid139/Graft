# Overview Dashboard Template

## Intent

Use this for monitor-style dashboards and high-level operational overviews.

## Structure

- Page header
- Metric cards
- Trend chart card
- Status/dependency cards
- Runtime detail cards

## Notes

- Keep numbers prominent and labels compact.
- Place the chart inside a token-aware card.
- Make status clear before making it decorative.

## Do

- Use `Card`, `Row`, `Col`, `Tag`, `Tabs`, `Empty`, `Alert`, `Table`.
- Sync chart colors with mode and brand theme.

## Don’t

- Copy generic SaaS analytics dashboards.
- Use chart colors that ignore theme tokens.
- Hide the operational meaning behind visuals.
